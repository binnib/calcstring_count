"String Calculator in Ruby"

 Assignment: https://blog.incubyte.co/blog/tdd-assessment/

This is a small Ruby program that takes a string of numbers and calculates their sum.  
It supports:

- Comma and newline (`\n`) as default delimiters
- Custom delimiters using the format `//[delimiter]\n[numbers]`
- Throws an error if the input contains negative numbers

Useful for learning string parsing, simple error handling, and test-driven development in Ruby.
